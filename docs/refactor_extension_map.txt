Refactor Extension Map (Pipeline, Compiler, New Peripherals)

Last reviewed: 2026-02-04

This file links current implementation boundaries to planned team-project extensions.

1) Pipeline implementation (staged instruction fetch/execution)

Current baseline
- Fetch already has one register boundary in `soc` (`insn_q`).
- CPU internals are split into `control_unit` and `datapath`.

Recommended staging points
- Stage F0: PC generation and IMEM address issue (`i_ad`).
- Stage F1: instruction latch (`insn_q`) and branch-annul/NOP injection.
- Stage D/X: control decode + ALU/address execution.
- Stage M/W: load data return + register writeback (with hazard controls).

Signals to preserve as architectural contracts
- `insn_ce`, `rdy`, `lw/lb/sw/sb`, `br_taken`, `irq_take`, `irq_vector`, `int_en`.

2) Compiler backend (Flex/Bison frontend + subset-C backend)

Required backend assumptions from ABI
- arguments: `a0-a2`
- return: `a0`
- caller/callee save split exactly per `abi_spec.txt`
- stack: full descending (`sp` word steps)
- call/return: `CALL`/`RET` equivalent sequence
- interrupt-safe code generation (if compiler emits ISRs): GETCC/SETCC + CLI/STI discipline

Assembler integration
- Backend can emit:
  1) macro-friendly assembly using `abi.inc`, or
  2) raw canonical ISA mnemonics accepted by `tools/assembler.py`.

3) Graphics/audio and tactile serial peripherals

Current MMIO decode pattern
- Region select by `d_ad[15]` and `addr[11:8]` in `periph_bus`.

Available decode space (suggested)
- `0x8400-0x84FF`: keyboard controller
- `0x8500-0x85FF`: mouse controller
- `0x8600-0x86FF`: audio control FIFO/MMIO
- `0x8700-0x87FF`: graphics command registers
- `0x8800-0x88FF`: frame buffer window or DMA control

Integration checklist for each new peripheral
- Add select decode in `periph_bus`.
- Add module instance with `sel/we/re/addr/wdata/rdata/rdy` contract.
- Add interrupt line into `int_cause[]` map and document IRQ index/priority.
- Add software-visible register map and update ABI/compiler headers.
- Add focused unit testbench + SoC integration test mode.

4) Priority and interrupt scaling
- `irq_ctrl` currently prioritizes IRQ[3:0] in fixed hardware order.
- For more devices, extend priority encoder and vector table policy.
- Keep vector map and software IVT layout synchronized.

5) Synchronization rule
- Every ISA/ABI/MMIO change should update all of:
  - RTL decode/behavior
  - `tools/assembler.py`
  - `tools/abi.inc`
  - `documentation/isa_reference.txt`
  - `documentation/abi_spec.txt`
  - `documentation/assembler/isa_abi_assembler_checklist.txt`
